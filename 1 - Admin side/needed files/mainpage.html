          “Every person has sufficient resources to grow and face the difficulties they encounter in life.” This is the guide that Khim uses in her counselling practice. According to her, counselling is like a treasure hunt, where the client discovers the treasure within themselves to deal with the difficulties they encounter in life. Counselling is a process where the counsellor accompanies the client in their search for their strengths and resources.

Khim holds a Bachelor’s degree (Hons) in Food Technology from University of Science Malaysia (USM) and a Master's degree in Guidance and Counselling from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). She has been working in the education sector for more than 10 years, assisting students from secondary to tertiary institutions. During her service, Khim has organised and conducted various workshops for her students.

            “In my early professional years, I was asking the question: How can I treat, or cure, or change this person? Now I would phrase the question in this way: How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth?” This quote (from Carl Rogers) guides Sandy in his counselling style, focusing less on trying to “fix” or “change” clients, and more on helping them explore and appreciate who they are so they can create desired change for themselves. 

Sandy received his Master's degree in Counselling from Monash University and has since trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Motivational Interviewing, and his primary approach, Existential Therapy. Influenced by existential psychotherapists such as Irvin Yalom and Emmy van Deurzen, his work with clients includes helping those going through grief and bereavement, experiencing anxiety, suicidal thoughts and feelings, and existential issues such as self-exploration, creating meaning in life, feeling lost, struggling with decisions, and relationship issues. 

Sandy also has an interest in mindfulness and positive psychology and is the author of Mindfulness and Emotions (MPH, 2019), and the bi-weekly Sunny Side Up column (The Star).
